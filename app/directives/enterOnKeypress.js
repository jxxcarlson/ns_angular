This directive allows us to pass a function in on an enter key to do what we want.

Thatâ€™s it.  Now just add ng-enter="myFunction()" to any element in your partial
that detects keystrokes. This has helped me a ton and added a lot of easy
functionality to an already great AngularJS system.  If you have any other
great directives or AngularJS tips please leave them below in the comments.

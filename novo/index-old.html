    <p>Concerto Novo is proud to present An Evening of Classical and New Music at Carnegie Hall on October 1, 8 PM.</p>

    <p>The concert features the world premiere of George Oakley's Stabat Mater.  It also features Georgian cellist Lizi Ramishvili's United States debut, in which she will perform Oakley's Sonata for Cello and Piano.</p>

    <p>This chamber concert will take the audience through three distinct musical periods: The Classical period, represented by the Beethoven's Sonata for Cello and Piano in D major, op. 102, the Romantic period with Schumann's Fantasiestücke, op. 73, and through to contemporary classical via New York-based Georgian composer George Oakley.</p>

    <p>The concert will present the World Premiere of Oakley's Stabat Mater, for chorus and harp, written exclusively for the Nikolai Kachanov Singers and taking its musical inspiration from the medieval period, filtered through a modern mentality. Also on the program is Oakley's deeply moving Sonata for Cello and Piano which premiered at Merkin Hall in February 2014 to a standing ovation.
